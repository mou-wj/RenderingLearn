Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC)
Dependencies

Install:

Vulkan SDK
Git

Ensure the following tools are available in PATH:

python --version
cmake --version
Build
Step 1: Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/mou-wj/WREngine.git
cd WREngine
Step 2: Run Setup Script

Before configuring with CMake, run the Python setup script.

This step generates required files, prepares dependencies, and configures build prerequisites.

python BuildDeps.py

This step is required.
CMake configuration may fail if skipped.

Step 3: Configure Project
cmake -S . -B build

Or for Visual Studio 2022:

cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
Step 4: Build

Debug:

cmake --build out --config Debug

Release:

cmake --build out --config Release

Run

Notes
The Python setup step is mandatory.
If dependencies are updated, rerun:
python BuildDeps.py
Delete the out/ folder if CMake cache becomes invalid.
